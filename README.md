# Bismark_auto
A script which can use the bismark tool automatically to process the genome files, and analysis the fastaq files generated by methylome sequencing

The Bismark is a program used to map sequencing readings from sulfite treatment to the genome of interest and perform methylation calls in one step.
This script can be used to run the Bismark automatically, all you need to do is just tell the path of input files(including genome_build_folder), and the path of the output file

Python bismark_auto <path/to/input> <path/to/output>
